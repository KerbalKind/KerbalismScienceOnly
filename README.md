# KerbalismScienceOnly

A Kerbalism configuration that disables everything Kerablism does, except for the science feature.

## Compatibility

With this configuration, you shoud be able to use Kerablism with any other life support mod. It won't interfere with TAC-LS, and it will not kill Kerbals when they run out of resources.

The only thing that will not work with Kerbalism Science is most science related mods.
