# KerbalismScienceOnly

A Kerbalism configuration that disables everything Kerablism does, except for the science feature.

## Warning

This configuration pack is a bit outdated and isn't actively maintained. It mostly works, but there are many quirks and balance issues. We don't really provide any support for it, so be aware that you're on your own.

## Compatibility

With this configuration pack, you shoud be able to use Kerbalism with any other life support mod. It won't interfere with TAC-LS, and it will not kill Kerbals when they run out of resources.

The only thing that will not work with Kerbalism Science is most science related mods.
